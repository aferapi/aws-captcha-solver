# Best Way to Bypass AWS WAF Captcha: Step by Step Tutorial 2024

AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall) is a security service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that helps protect web applications from common web vulnerabilities and attacks. It acts as a barrier between web clients and application servers, filtering and monitoring incoming traffic based on predefined rules.AWS WAF sometimes challenges users with CAPTCHA to ensure that traffic is coming from legitimate human users. In this article, we will explore what AWS WAF is, the conditions for bypassing AWS WAF, and provide a suggested solution, complete with steps.

## What is AWS WAF Captcha
AWS WAF is a managed firewall service that allows users to define customisable rules to control access to their web applications. It helps protect against common web vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. By analysing incoming web requests, AWS WAF can detect and block malicious traffic, ensuring the security and availability of AWS-hosted web applications. In short, AWS WAF is a web application firewall that helps protect web applications.

## When will AWS WAF be triggered?
Bypassing AWS WAF CAPTCHA requires understanding and addressing specific conditions that may trigger its activation. These conditions may include: a. Suspicious Traffic Patterns.

a. Suspicious Traffic Patterns: AWS WAF may activate a CAPTCHA challenge if it detects unusual or suspicious traffic patterns, such as a large number of requests from a single IP address or a sudden spike in traffic.

b. Abusive Behavior: Engaging in abusive behavior, such as too fast or repeated requests, may trigger AWS WAF to activate a CAPTCHA challenge to prevent automated scraping or bot-based attacks.

c. Anomalous User Agent Strings: AWS WAF may flag anomalous or suspicious user agent strings in the HTTP header, which may result in the activation of a CAPTCHA challenge.

## How to Bypass AWS WAF:
To bypass AWS WAF Captcha, here is a recommended approach:

a. Rotate IP Addresses: AWS WAF may track and block suspicious IP addresses associated with scraping or abusive activities. By rotating your IP address using proxy servers or VPN services, you can avoid being flagged or blocked by AWS WAF, enhancing your chances of bypassing Captcha challenges.

b. Emulate Human Behavior: To further mimic human behavior, introduce random delays between your requests and vary the timing and order of actions performed during scraping or automation. This helps make your activities appear more natural and reduces the likelihood of triggering Captcha challenges.

c. Using CAPTCHA solver: a more efficient and faster way is to use a captcha solver, such as the market superior solution, Capsolver, currently supports the solution of a variety of Captcha, including aws waf, both api and extension in the speed and accuracy are guaranteed, Capsolver can be integrated into your scraping or automated work process. 

## Bypassing AWS WAF with Capsolver

The following steps can be found on how to bypass the target captcha and complete the captcha solving

### Create Task

Create a recognition task with the [createTask](../api-createtask.md) method.
#### Example Request

``` json
POST https://api.capsolver.com/createTask
Host: api.capsolver.com
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "clientKey": "YOUR_API_KEY",
    "task": {
        "type": "AntiAwsWafTask", //Required
        "websiteURL": "https://efw47fpad9.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/latest", //Required
        "awsKey": "",
        "awsIv": "",
        "awsContext": "",
        "awsChallengeJS": "",
        "proxy": "http:ip:port:user:pass" // socks5:ip:port:user:pass // Optional
    }
}
```

After you submit the task to us, you should receive in the response a 'Task id' if it's successfull. Please
read [errorCode: full list of errors](../api-createtask.md) if you didn't receive the task id. For more information, you can
also refer to this blog post [How to solve aws amazon captcha token](https://www.capsolver.com/blog/All/how-to-solve-aws-amazon-captcha-token)

#### Example Response

``` json
{
    "errorId": 0,
    "errorCode": "",
    "errorDescription": "",
    "taskId": "61138bb6-19fb-11ec-a9c8-0242ac110006"
}
```

### Getting Results

After you have the taskId, you need to submit the taskId to retrieve the solution. Response structure is explained
in [getTaskResult](../api-gettaskresult.md).

Depending on the system load, you will get the results within the interval of `5s` to `30s`

#### Example Request

``` json
POST https://api.capsolver.com/getTaskResult
Host: api.capsolver.com
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "clientKey": "YOUR_API_KEY",
    "taskId": "61138bb6-19fb-11ec-a9c8-0242ac110006"
}
```

#### Example Response

```json
{
  "errorId": 0,
  "taskId": "646825ef-9547-4a29-9a05-50a6265f9d8a",
  "status": "ready",
  "solution": {
    "cookie": "223d1f60-0e9f-4238-ac0a-e766b15a778e:EQoAf0APpGIKAAAA:AJam3OWpff1VgKIJxH4lGMMHxPVQ0q0R3CNtgcMbR4VvnIBSpgt1Otbax4kuqrgkEp0nFKanO5oPtwt9+Butf7lt0JNe4rZQwZ5IrEnkXvyeZQPaCFshHOISAFLTX7AWHldEXFlZEg7DjIc="
  }
}
```

### Use SDK Request

::: code-group

```python
# pip install --upgrade capsolver
# export CAPSOLVER_API_KEY='...'

import capsolver

# capsolver.api_key = "..."
solution = capsolver.solve({
    "type": "AntiAwsWafTask",
    "websiteURL": "https://efw47fpad9.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/latest",
    "proxy": "ip:port:user:pass"
})
```

```go [golang]
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	capsolver_go "github.com/capsolver/capsolver-go"
	"log"
)

func main() {
	// first you need to install sdk
	//go get github.com/capsolver/capsolver-go
	//export CAPSOLVER_API_KEY='...' or
	//capSolver := CapSolver{ApiKey:"..."}

	capSolver := capsolver_go.CapSolver{}
	solution, err := capSolver.Solve(map[string]any{
		"type": "AntiAwsWafTaskProxyLess",
		"websiteURL": "AntiAwsWafTask",
		 "proxy":"ip:port:user:pass"
	})
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
		return
	}
	fmt.Println(solution)
}
